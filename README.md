<b>How to run?</b><br>
`git clone https://github.com/dnb02/sky-lover.git`<br>
`cd sky-lover`<br>
To begin the server do `make server`<br>
To start the client do `make gui`<br>


<b>Note:</b><br>
All the classes have been made modular and a combined server has been written to use them together.<br>
They can be used as <b>standalone</b> also.<br>
